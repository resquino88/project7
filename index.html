                        <p class="lead">I am currently a senior at the University of Pittsburgh majoring in Computer Science. My field focuses on the innovation and development of technology to efficiently solve past, current, and future problems. Having worked as an ice hockey instructor, nothing is more fulfilling than using my current knowledge to help someone else out. Being part of this field allows me to help others learn and solve their problems while also contributing to society. Because of this, my dream job is to be a software engineer for a company in the medical field. Areas of interest of mine include:</p>

                        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
                        <p class="lead">A lot of my hobbies include sports, hockey, tennis, volleyball, and exercising. Whenever I feel the need to take a break, going for a run or playing hockey at my local municipal park helps relieve my mind. Not sport related, I enjoy reading books about history and fiction and brushing up on mathematical concepts. Some recent books that I have read include <i>The Second Founding</i>, which describes how the Civil War remade the Constitution, and the Harry Potter series. As for mathematics, topics covered in calculus one and two are my favorite to read over since they have applications to my field of study. For example, summations can be used to determine the runtime of algorithms for efficiency checks.</p>
